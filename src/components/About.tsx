                We are not a team of licensed psychologists, but a small group of developers and educators who've built this platform using AI technologies combined with open-source, research-backed psychological frameworks. Our mission is to bring the science of personality, emotional intelligence, and wellbeing to your fingertips in a way that is practical, insightful, and affordable.

              <p>
                We know that deep self-insight isn't just for corporate executives or therapy sessions. It's for students finding their path, professionals navigating challenges, and anyone wanting to understand themselves a little better today than yesterday.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our AI-powered assessments are built on validated constructs in psychology such as the Big Five personality traits, emotional intelligence models, and wellbeing frameworks. We combine these with modern technology to make them accessible anytime, anywhere.
