### Step 2: Code Deployment
```bash
# Clone repository (or copy files)
git clone <repository-url> .

# Or copy files from deployment package
# scp -r backend-migration/* user@server:/opt/authencore/
```
- [ ] Code deployed to server
- [ ] All files and directories present
- [ ] Permissions set correctly

### Step 3: Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy and configure environment file
cp config/environment.template .env
nano .env  # Configure all variables

# Validate environment
./scripts/validate-environment.sh
```
- [ ] Environment file configured
- [ ] All required variables set
- [ ] Environment validation passes

### Step 4: SSL Certificate Setup
```bash
# Copy SSL certificates
sudo mkdir -p ssl/
sudo cp your-cert.pem ssl/cert.pem
sudo cp your-key.pem ssl/key.pem
sudo cp ca-bundle.pem ssl/ca-bundle.pem
sudo chown root:root ssl/*
sudo chmod 600 ssl/*
```
- [ ] SSL certificates installed
- [ ] Certificate files secured
- [ ] Nginx configuration updated

### Step 5: Database Setup
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL (if using Docker)
docker-compose --profile prod up -d postgres

# Wait for database to be ready
sleep 30

# Run database migrations
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/001_initial_schema.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/002_database_functions.sql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/003_rls_policies.sql
